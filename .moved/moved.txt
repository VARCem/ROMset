#
#		ROM BIOS distribution ("ROM Set") set.
#
#		Sometimes, ROM sets have to moved to a different location,
#		and this usually will affect systems that did update their
#		copy of VARCem itself, but not the ROM set files.
#
#		To help those systems, we now can keep a "address change"
#		in this file, where the lines are like:
#
#		old_path/bios.txt  <whitespace> new_path/bios.txt
#
#		to point the ROM loader to the new location. It would be
#		helpful if a date is also listed, so old entries can be
#		removed every now and then.
#
#		If this is used, the logfile (if any) will show that the
#		relocated path was used instead of the requested one.
