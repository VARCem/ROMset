Welcome to **VARCem**, the Virtual Archaeological Computer EMulator.

VARCem is a software application which emulates a selection of of (mostly)
x86-based PC systems and devices based on the ISA, VLB, MCA and PCI buses.

The program tries to be cycle-exact, meaning the guest software (the software
being run inside the emulated system) will run as fast (or, depending on how
you see that..) as slow as it did "back then".  If you selected, say, a 80286
running at 12MHz, that is what the software will see, and how fast it will be
run.

This is the ROM Set of the emulator, or, the collection of images dumped from
the original "BIOS ROM" chips of the emulated machines and their accessory
cards. These files are needed to run.

The contents of the included ROM BIOS images are property
of their respective owners. Although the  software  could
be considered 'abandonware' given their age, these  files
files are distributed in the hope they will be of use for
personal enjoyment ONLY.
